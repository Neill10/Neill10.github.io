                        Unfortunately, with as many benefits that AI brings to the table, there is also a myriad of problems that arise from the use of this technology.

                        <p>
                            The major drawback of using of AI is how unethical it can be.
                            Since AI can self learn to achieve satisfying results, companies will choose them over human laborers
                            This in turn, will lead to the loss of many jobs. 
                            <br>
                            Not only that but the current use of AI invades our privacy. 
                            As I've touched upon before, in order for an AI program to learn by itself, it has to take in a large amount of data. 
                            That doesn't really raise any red flags...until you realize that some of these data can be sensitive personal information.
                            That runs the risk of leaking terabytes of data to the world.

                            This quote was Stated 7 years ago in 2015 in an open letter advising against the use of AI in warfare.
                            In that letter it implies that if an AI arms races were to happen, it is just a matter of time before they appear on the black market or in the hands of malicious groups.
                            They don't even have to be physically destructive to pose a threat to us.
                            <br>Image and Video manipulation is possible with the use of AI.
                            Just a few months ago, a deepfake of Ukraine president emerged telling soldiers to lay down their arms. 
                            Not only does this go against public safety, it is becoming increasing harder to differentiate what's real.

                                Due to how reliant we are on the internet these days, we have become accustomed to giving away sensitive information.
                                Information that could be fed into an AI program. If major breaches happen, our personal info would be compromised allowing people with malicious intent to prey on vulnerable people.

                            Due to the nature of how some AI program works, these AI programs can become biased.
                            There can be cases of engineers choosing a skewed data set to fed into the program resulting in disparities in outcomes.
                            These can affect whether a person is admitted into a school, hired for a job, or receive additional help in medical care.
